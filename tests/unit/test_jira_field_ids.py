"""The five copies of the Jira custom-field IDs must agree with fields.md.

ADR-0006 accepts duplicating these IDs so a skill installs alone. The cost is a
failure mode with no symptom: a stale copy reads a `customfield_*` key that is
not there, yields "", and the caller reports missing data instead of raising.

Only the offline half of the validator runs here. The `--live` half needs `acli`
and a Jira session, which CI does not have — but it is also not the half that
catches this. A copy drifting from the reference table is, and that comparison is
pure text.
