# Create Epic

Create an RHIDP Epic from conversation context. Grills the user on delivery scope, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. Optionally chains into Story/Task decomposition.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Determine Context

Two entry modes:

- **Chained from Feature**: Context carries down. The Feature's scope, AC, and customer considerations are established. The grill narrows to delivery scope for this team.
- **Standalone**: Full grill. No parent Feature context.

If chained, the parent Feature key is known. If standalone, ask: "Is this Epic part of an existing Feature? [Feature key / no]"

### Step 2 — Draft from Context

Load `assets/templates/epic.txt` for structure and `assets/examples/epic-example.txt` for tone calibration.

Synthesize: Draft as many template sections as possible from the conversation (and parent Feature if chained):

- EPIC Goal, Background/Feature Origin, Why important, User Scenarios, Dependencies, AC

If chained from a Feature, pre-fill: Goal (scoped to this team's delivery), Background (link to parent Feature), Dependencies (other Epics in the Feature).

Present the draft: "Here's what I have for this Epic. Review and tell me what's missing."

### Step 3 — Fill Gaps

For unfilled sections, ask targeted questions. Adapt based on entry mode:

**Chained (narrowed):**

1. **EPIC Goal** — what does *this team's* delivery achieve within the parent Feature?
2. **Dependencies** — internal (other Epics) and external (upstream, other teams)
3. **Acceptance Criteria** — team-specific. Which checklist items apply? (DEV, QE, DOC)

**Standalone (full):**

1. **EPIC Goal** — what are we trying to solve?
2. **Background/Feature Origin** — where did this come from?
3. **Why is this important?**
4. **User Scenarios** — who benefits and how?
5. **Dependencies** — internal and external
6. **Acceptance Criteria** — full checklist

Skip questions the draft already answered.

### Step 4 — Challenge

Follow the challenging behavior in `references/grill.md`.

### Step 5 — Infer Fields

Infer all Jira fields per `references/grill.md` Field Inference. If chained, inherit Priority and Team from parent Feature. Key fields: Team, Priority, Size (T-shirt), Component, Assignee (Epic Owner).

**Components:** Infer from the epic description and validate against the project's component list per `references/fields.md` → Component Validation. If the epic involves documentation, set the `Documentation` component.

**Dependencies:** Link or note key dependencies on other issues, teams, or upstream work.

### Step 6 — Review

Render the filled template and inferred fields as a temporary markdown file for user review:

```bash
cat > /tmp/epic-review.md << 'EOF'
## Epic: {summary}

### Description
{filled template content}

### Fields
- **Priority**: {value}
- **Team**: {value}
- **Size**: {value}
- **Component**: {value}
- **Assignee**: {value}
EOF
```

Present to the user: "Review the Epic before creating. [approve / edit / cancel]"

### Step 7 — Duplicate Check

Run the pre-creation check from `references/duplicates.md`. Search RHIDP Epics (`issuetype = Epic`).

### Step 8 — Create Epic

Fill the template. Then convert to ADF using the helper script (see Gotcha #6). `acli create` accepts ADF via `--description-file`:

```bash
EPIC_ADF=$(mktemp)  # on Windows: use %TEMP% or Python tempfile
python scripts/jira-wiki-to-adf.py epic-filled.txt "$EPIC_ADF"
```

Create the issue — note `--priority`, `--component`, and `--yes` do not exist on `create` (see Gotcha #18):

```bash
acli jira workitem create --project RHIDP --type Epic \
  --summary "Epic summary" \
  --description-file "$EPIC_ADF" \
  --assignee "ACCOUNT_ID"
```

Then set priority, components, size, and parent Feature link together in one REST call. Cross-project parent links accept either `customfield_10018` or `parent.key` — do not use `issuelinks` (see Gotcha #16):

```bash
curl -s -X PUT -u "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fields": {
      "priority": {"name": "Major"},
      "components": [{"name": "Catalog"}],
      "customfield_10795": {"value": "M"},
      "customfield_10018": "RHDHPLAN-XXX"
    }
  }' \
  "https://redhat.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issue/RHIDP-XXX"
```

Set Team via REST — follow API preference order in SKILL.md.

### Step 9 — Comments

Follow the comment suggestion behavior from `references/grill.md` — proactively suggest decision trail, elaboration, and abandoned paths as comments.

Add via `acli jira workitem comment --key RHIDP-XXX --comment "text" --yes`.

### Step 10 — Chain Decomposition

After the Epic is created:

> "Break this Epic into Stories/Tasks? [y/N]"

If yes:

1. Discuss the breakdown: what are the deliverable slices?
2. For each slice, invoke the `to-issue` workflow with context carried down:
   - The Epic's goal, AC, and dependencies are established
   - The issue grill narrows to: implementation specifics, story points, approach
3. Each Story/Task is automatically linked to the parent Epic via `parent` field
4. Type inference runs per slice (Story if user-facing, Task if internal)

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| RHIDP project inaccessible | Stop. User lacks project access. |
| Parent Feature key invalid | Warn. Create Epic without parent link. |
| `acli create` fails | Fall back to REST API. |
| Parent link update fails | Report failure. Epic is created — user can link manually. |

## Caveats

1. **Epic Owner responsibility.** The assignee is the Epic Owner — single point of contact for delivery, works with the Feature Owner to align execution. The Epic Owner is responsible for sizing the Epic.
2. **Component is required at New status.** Don't skip this during the grill. Validate against `references/fields.md` → Component Validation.
3. **Multi-team Features create multiple Epics.** When chained from a Feature, each team gets its own Epic. The Feature Owner coordinates across them.
4. **Size via sizing guide.** Use T-shirt sizing per `references/sizing.md`. If the parent Feature has multiple L or XL Epics, flag for the Feature Owner — the Feature scope may need reassessment.
