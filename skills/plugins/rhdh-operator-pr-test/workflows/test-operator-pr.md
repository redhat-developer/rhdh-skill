# Workflow: Test rhdh-operator PR on Live Cluster

Deploy a PR's CI-built images onto a running RHDH cluster, verify the change
there, and report evidence.

## Phase 1: Read the PR through `/rhdh-forge`

Invoke `/rhdh-forge` with the PR URL or number. Consume repository, number,
state, files, diff, head and base refs, and comments.

Carry:

```
REPO="redhat-developer/rhdh-operator"
PR_NUMBER=<number>
```

Stop unless the repository is `redhat-developer/rhdh-operator`. Warn if state is
not `OPEN` — images may still work, but the PR is not active.

---

## Phase 2: Extract CI-built images

Follow `../references/operator-pr-images.md`. Parse operator, operator-bundle,
and operator-catalog URLs from the comments `/rhdh-forge` returned, then
validate the operator image exists.

---

## Phase 3: Ensure a Running RHDH Cluster

### 3.1 Verify cluster access

```bash
oc whoami 2>&1
oc cluster-info 2>/dev/null | head -2
```

### 3.2 Check for running RHDH operator

```bash
oc get deployment -A -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name \
  --no-headers 2>/dev/null | grep -i rhdh-operator
```

### 3.3 Check for Backstage CR

```bash
oc get backstage -A 2>/dev/null
```

### 3.4 Decision tree

| Cluster state | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Operator running + Backstage CR exists | Skip to Phase 4 |
| Cluster accessible but no RHDH operator | Deploy RHDH on existing cluster (see 3.5b) |
| `oc whoami` fails | Human `oc login`, or provision via rhdh-test-instance (see 3.5a) |

### 3.5 Provision or deploy RHDH

Use `redhat-developer/rhdh-test-instance` and read that checkout's current
README and Makefile for supported deployment commands. `/rhdh-context` locates
an RHDH checkout when one is needed.

- **`oc whoami` fails** → first path is `oc login` to an existing cluster. If
  they have no cluster, propose the rhdh-test-instance PR workflow: comment
  `/test deploy operator <version> 4h` on a PR. Match the version to the target
  branch. Invoke `/mutation-gate` for that comment. The request to test does not
  itself approve the comment.
- **Cluster accessible but no RHDH** → render the exact rhdh-test-instance
  install/deploy and cleanup commands from its current README and Makefile.
  Invoke `/mutation-gate` for those operations.

Once the operator and Backstage CR are healthy, proceed to Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4: Deploy PR Operator

### 4.1 Detect install method

```bash
oc get subscription -A 2>/dev/null | grep -i rhdh
```

- If Subscription found → **OLM-managed** (use 4.4a)
- If no Subscription → **direct deployment** (use 4.4b)

### 4.2 Identify operator deployment and namespace

```bash
OPERATOR_NS_MATCHES=$(oc get deployment -A --no-headers \
  -o custom-columns=NS:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name \
  | grep rhdh-operator | awk '{print $1}')

OPERATOR_NS_COUNT=$(printf '%s\n' "$OPERATOR_NS_MATCHES" | sed '/^$/d' | wc -l)
if [ "$OPERATOR_NS_COUNT" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Expected exactly 1 rhdh-operator namespace, found $OPERATOR_NS_COUNT"
  printf 'Matches:\n%s\n' "$OPERATOR_NS_MATCHES"
  exit 1
fi
OPERATOR_NS=$(printf '%s\n' "$OPERATOR_NS_MATCHES" | sed '/^$/d')

OPERATOR_DEPLOY_MATCHES=$(oc get deployment -n "$OPERATOR_NS" --no-headers \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep rhdh-operator)

OPERATOR_DEPLOY_COUNT=$(printf '%s\n' "$OPERATOR_DEPLOY_MATCHES" | sed '/^$/d' | wc -l)
if [ "$OPERATOR_DEPLOY_COUNT" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo "Expected exactly 1 rhdh-operator deployment in $OPERATOR_NS, found $OPERATOR_DEPLOY_COUNT"
  printf 'Matches:\n%s\n' "$OPERATOR_DEPLOY_MATCHES"
  exit 1
fi
OPERATOR_DEPLOY=$(printf '%s\n' "$OPERATOR_DEPLOY_MATCHES" | sed '/^$/d')
```

### 4.3 Record current state (for rollback)

**OLM-managed — record Subscription for rollback:**

```bash
CURRENT_SUB=$(oc get subscription -n $OPERATOR_NS --no-headers \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name 2>/dev/null | grep rhdh)

# Record original source info (the CatalogSource is typically shared in openshift-marketplace)
ORIGINAL_SOURCE=$(oc get subscription $CURRENT_SUB -n $OPERATOR_NS \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.source}')
ORIGINAL_SOURCE_NS=$(oc get subscription $CURRENT_SUB -n $OPERATOR_NS \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.sourceNamespace}')
echo "Current Subscription: $CURRENT_SUB, source: $ORIGINAL_SOURCE in $ORIGINAL_SOURCE_NS"

# Export Subscription for rollback (do NOT touch the shared CatalogSource)
oc get subscription $CURRENT_SUB -n $OPERATOR_NS -o yaml > /tmp/rollback-subscription.yaml
```

**Non-OLM — save the original install.yaml for rollback:**

```bash
CURRENT_IMAGE=$(oc get deployment $OPERATOR_DEPLOY -n $OPERATOR_NS \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=="manager")].image}')
echo "Current operator image: $CURRENT_IMAGE"
```

Ask `/rhdh-forge` for `dist/rhdh/install.yaml` on the PR base ref and write it
to `/tmp/rollback-install.yaml`.

### 4.4a Deploy full bundle — OLM-managed install

Before the first `oc delete` or `oc apply`, finish rendering every manifest.
Invoke `/mutation-gate` and follow it.

Patching the CSV image or the Deployment directly misses PR changes to CRDs,
RBAC, default config, or bundle metadata. Replace the CatalogSource with the
PR's catalog image so OLM reinstalls the complete bundle.

**Step 1: Remove existing Subscription and CSV**

Do NOT delete the original CatalogSource — it is typically shared (e.g., `redhat-operators` in `openshift-marketplace`) and serves other operators.

```bash
PR_CATALOG_IMAGE="quay.io/rhdh-community/operator-catalog:<tag>"

# Delete Subscription first (stops OLM from managing the operator)
oc delete subscription $CURRENT_SUB -n $OPERATOR_NS

# Delete the CSV (removes the operator deployment)
CSV_NAME=$(oc get csv -n $OPERATOR_NS --no-headers \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep rhdh)
oc delete csv $CSV_NAME -n $OPERATOR_NS
```

**Step 2: Create CatalogSource pointing to PR catalog image**

```bash
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: CatalogSource
metadata:
  name: rhdh-operator-pr-catalog
  namespace: $OPERATOR_NS
spec:
  sourceType: grpc
  image: $PR_CATALOG_IMAGE
  displayName: RHDH Operator PR Catalog
  publisher: PR Test
  updateStrategy:
    registryPoll:
      interval: 10m
EOF
```

**Step 3: Ensure OperatorGroup exists**

```bash
OG_EXISTS=$(oc get operatorgroup -n $OPERATOR_NS --no-headers 2>/dev/null | wc -l)
if [ "$OG_EXISTS" -eq 0 ]; then
  cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: rhdh-operator-group
  namespace: $OPERATOR_NS
EOF
fi
```

**Step 4: Create Subscription pointing to PR CatalogSource**

```bash
# Discover the package name and channel from the PR catalog
PACKAGE_NAME=$(oc get packagemanifest -l "catalog=rhdh-operator-pr-catalog" \
  --no-headers -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name 2>/dev/null | head -1)
CHANNEL=$(oc get packagemanifest $PACKAGE_NAME \
  -o jsonpath='{.status.defaultChannel}' 2>/dev/null)

# Fall back to known defaults if discovery fails
PACKAGE_NAME=${PACKAGE_NAME:-rhdh}
CHANNEL=${CHANNEL:-fast}

cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: rhdh-operator-pr-subscription
  namespace: $OPERATOR_NS
spec:
  channel: $CHANNEL
  name: $PACKAGE_NAME
  source: rhdh-operator-pr-catalog
  sourceNamespace: $OPERATOR_NS
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
EOF
```

**Step 5: Wait for OLM to deploy the operator**

```bash
# Give OLM time to poll the CatalogSource and create the InstallPlan
echo "Waiting for OLM to process Subscription..."
sleep 30

# Wait for CSV to appear and reach Succeeded phase
echo "Waiting for CSV to succeed..."
for i in $(seq 1 6); do
  oc wait csv -n $OPERATOR_NS -l "operators.coreos.com/$PACKAGE_NAME.$OPERATOR_NS=" \
    --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Succeeded --timeout=30s 2>/dev/null && break
  echo "CSV not ready yet (attempt $i/6)..."
  sleep 10
done

# Re-detect the operator deployment name (may have changed)
OPERATOR_DEPLOY=$(oc get deployment -n $OPERATOR_NS --no-headers \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep rhdh-operator)
```

OLM will apply the full bundle contents: updated CRDs, RBAC, default config, and the operator Deployment with the PR's operator image.

### 4.4b Deploy full manifests — direct deployment (non-OLM)

Invoke `/mutation-gate` before changing a direct deployment. The rendered
install and rollback manifests are the previews; do not show placeholders and
do not regenerate the manifests after approval.

`oc set image` only swaps the binary and misses CRD, RBAC, and default config
changes from the PR. Apply the full `install.yaml` from the PR head instead.

**Step 1: Head ref and PR operator image**

Use the head ref `/rhdh-forge` already returned. Set
`PR_IMAGE` to the CI-built operator image from Phase 2.

**Step 2: Fetch install.yaml from the PR head**

Ask `/rhdh-forge` for `dist/rhdh/install.yaml` on the PR head ref and write it
to `/tmp/pr-install.yaml`. If the file is empty, the PR may not have
regenerated `dist/` — check whether `make build-installer` ran.

If `files` has no path under `dist/`, warn: CRDs, RBAC, and default config in
the manifest are from the base branch; only the operator binary image will
differ after substitution.

**Step 3: Substitute the CI-built operator image**

```bash
sed -i "s|image: quay.io/rhdh/rhdh-rhel9-operator:.*|image: ${PR_IMAGE}|g" /tmp/pr-install.yaml

# Verify substitution
grep "image:.*operator" /tmp/pr-install.yaml
```

**Step 4: Apply the full manifests**

```bash
oc apply -f /tmp/pr-install.yaml
```

This applies the complete set of resources from the PR: CRDs, ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings, ServiceAccount, ConfigMaps (including default config), and the operator Deployment.

### 4.5 Wait for rollout

```bash
# Re-detect deployment name in case it changed (OLM may use a different name)
OPERATOR_DEPLOY=$(oc get deployment -n $OPERATOR_NS --no-headers \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep rhdh-operator)

oc rollout status deployment/$OPERATOR_DEPLOY -n $OPERATOR_NS --timeout=180s
```

### 4.6 Verify the deployment

```bash
# Confirm new image is running
oc get deployment $OPERATOR_DEPLOY -n $OPERATOR_NS \
  -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[?(@.name=="manager")].image}'

# Check pod is healthy
oc get pods -n $OPERATOR_NS -l control-plane=controller-manager

# Check operator logs for errors
oc logs deployment/$OPERATOR_DEPLOY -n $OPERATOR_NS --tail=20

# Check Backstage CR health
RHDH_NS=$(oc get backstage -A --no-headers 2>/dev/null | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
if [ -n "$RHDH_NS" ]; then
  oc get backstage -n $RHDH_NS
  oc get pods -n $RHDH_NS
fi
```

### 4.7 Record rollback commands

Record rollback commands for Phase 7. Do not present them yet — they will be included in the findings report.

**OLM-managed — restore original Subscription:**

```bash
# Delete PR-specific OLM resources
oc delete subscription rhdh-operator-pr-subscription -n $OPERATOR_NS
CSV_NAME=$(oc get csv -n $OPERATOR_NS --no-headers \
  -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name | grep rhdh)
oc delete csv $CSV_NAME -n $OPERATOR_NS 2>/dev/null
oc delete catalogsource rhdh-operator-pr-catalog -n $OPERATOR_NS

# Restore original Subscription (points back to the shared CatalogSource)
oc apply -f /tmp/rollback-subscription.yaml

# Wait for OLM to redeploy the original operator
oc wait csv -n $OPERATOR_NS -l "operators.coreos.com/$PACKAGE_NAME.$OPERATOR_NS=" \
  --for=jsonpath='{.status.phase}'=Succeeded --timeout=180s
```

**Non-OLM — reapply original install.yaml:**

```bash
oc apply -f /tmp/rollback-install.yaml
```

## Phase 5: Generate a live verification checklist

Analyze the diff from Phase 1 and categorize changed files:

| File pattern | Category | Cluster focus |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| `api/`, `*_types.go` | CRD/API | New fields, deprecations, backward compatibility |
| `internal/controller/`, `pkg/model/` | Controller/Reconciler | Reconciliation behavior, status updates, edge cases |
| `config/profile/`, `default-config/` | Default config | Verify defaults applied, check for regressions |
| `*_test.go`, `integration_tests/` | Tests | Run the new/modified tests against the live cluster |
| `.github/`, `Makefile`, `Dockerfile` | Build/CI | Confirm the PR images under test match this build |

### Generate the checklist

For each category with changes, generate specific live checks.

**Always include these baseline checks:**

```markdown
### Baseline Checks
- [ ] Operator pod started successfully with PR image (no crash loops)
- [ ] Operator logs show no errors (`oc logs deployment/$OPERATOR_DEPLOY -n $OPERATOR_NS --tail=50`)
- [ ] Existing Backstage CR reconciled without errors
- [ ] RHDH pods are running and healthy
```

**CRD/API changes — add:**

```markdown
### CRD/API Verification
- [ ] Apply a Backstage CR with the new/changed field(s) set
- [ ] Apply a Backstage CR without the new field(s) — verify backward compatibility
- [ ] Verify existing CRs still reconcile correctly after CRD update
- [ ] Check `oc explain backstage.spec.<new-field>` shows correct schema
```

**Controller/Reconciler changes — add:**

```markdown
### Controller Verification
- [ ] Check operator logs during reconciliation for the changed code paths
- [ ] Verify status conditions update correctly on the Backstage CR
- [ ] Test with multiple Backstage CRs (if applicable)
- [ ] Delete and recreate a Backstage CR — verify clean reconciliation
```

**Default config changes — add:**

```markdown
### Default Config Verification
- [ ] Deploy a fresh Backstage CR with defaults only
- [ ] Verify changed defaults are applied to the RHDH deployment
- [ ] Compare pod spec / configmaps before and after the change
```

**Test changes — add:**

```markdown
### Tests
- [ ] `make integration-test USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true USE_EXISTING_CONTROLLER=true` — integration tests pass against live cluster
```

**End the checklist with:**

```markdown
### Rollback
When done testing, rollback the operator image:
[rollback commands from Phase 4.7]
```

---

## Phase 6: Active Verification

**This phase verifies the PR's specific code changes on the cluster — not generic health checks.** The goal is to exercise the exact code paths the PR modified and capture evidence that the behavioral change works as intended.

### 6.1 Analyze the diff

Read the diff hunks from Phase 1. For each changed file, understand:

- What the code did **before** the change
- What it does **after**
- What behavioral difference this introduces on a running cluster

Map each changed code path to a concrete cluster-observable effect — something you can trigger and measure on the running cluster. If a code change has no cluster-observable effect (e.g., pure refactor with identical behavior), state that explicitly and explain why.

### 6.2 Propose a verification mutation plan

For each test, specify:

- **What to do**: the exact cluster action (create resource, edit CR, delete pod, etc.)
- **What to observe**: where to look (logs, pod spec, CR status, events, API response)
- **Pass criteria**: what output means the fix works
- **Fail criteria**: what output means the fix is broken

Invoke `/mutation-gate` for cluster-changing verification. Read-only
observations stay checks.

### 6.3 Execute

Only after the user approves the stated operations:

Run each verification step on the cluster. For every step, capture the actual command output as evidence. Do not summarize — show the raw output so the user can see exactly what happened.

---

## Phase 7: Findings

Synthesize the verification results.

### 7.1 Verification summary

Summarize what was tested and the results:

| Category | Test performed | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| *[category]* | *[what was tested]* | Pass/Fail | *[key observation]* |

### 7.2 Rollback instructions

Present the rollback commands recorded in Phase 4.7. Do not regenerate them.

Before presenting the cluster report, invoke `/prose-editing` once on the
whole draft in the **flavored** register. Preserve raw evidence, tables,
commands, resource names, and rollback payloads exactly.

## Stops and waits

| Trigger | Type | What | Resume When |
|---------|------|------|-------------|
| No CI images found | Wait | CI workflow may still be running | Workflow completes and posts comment |
| Images expired | Stop | PR images past 14-day TTL | Author pushes new commit to retrigger CI |
| No cluster access | Stop | User needs to `oc login`, or chose rhdh-test-instance provision | User logs in or the provisioned cluster is ready |
| No RHDH instance | State, then deploy | Invoke `/mutation-gate` for the rhdh-test-instance deployment and cleanup | Reported outcomes show the operator and Backstage CR running |

## Completion

Complete when:

- [ ] PR images identified from CI comment
- [ ] Images validated as existing in Quay registry
- [ ] Cluster has RHDH operator deployed from PR bundle/manifests (not just image swap)
- [ ] Operator pod is healthy (no crash loops)
- [ ] Backstage CR reconciles successfully
- [ ] Live checks generated from the diff
- [ ] Active-verification operations stated and approved by user
- [ ] Verification executed with evidence captured
- [ ] Findings summary with pass/fail
- [ ] Rollback instructions documented and shared with user
- [ ] Check results and cleanup status reported
- [ ] Every external write has a reported outcome naming its target
