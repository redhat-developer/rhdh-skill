# Workflow: Fetch GitHub PR Context

Fetch PR metadata, diff, linked issues, existing comments, and CI status from
GitHub. Produces the PR context that `review-code.md` analyzes.

## Script

Run the fetch script to collect all PR context in one call:

```bash
uv run scripts/fetch_pr_context.py <PR_URL_OR_NUMBER> [--repo owner/repo]
```

The path is relative to the skill directory.

The script accepts:

- A full URL: `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`
- A number (detects repo from git remote): `123`
- A shorthand: `owner/repo#123`

Optional flags:

- `--repo owner/repo` — override repo detection
- `--no-diff` — skip diff (metadata-only queries)
- `--no-comments` — skip existing review comments
- `--no-issues` — skip fetching linked GitHub issues

Consume the full JSON output. Do not pipe through `head`, `tail`, or `grep`.

## PR context fields

The script prints one JSON object and nothing else. There is no envelope: these
fields are the whole document.

```
repository: "owner/repo"
changeRequest: {forge, number, headSha, baseRef, headRef, title, body, author, state, url, labels}
files: [{path, additions, deletions}, ...]
totalAdditions, totalDeletions
diff: "full unified diff text"
linkedIssues: [{number, title, body, labels, state}, ...]
jiraKeys: ["RHIDP-1234", ...]
existingComments: [{user, path, line, body, createdAt}, ...]
existingReviews: [{user, state, body}, ...]
ciStatus: "pass" | "fail" | "pending" | "unknown"
```

## Linked issues

`linkedIssues` carries the title, body, labels, and state of each GitHub issue
the PR body references — enough for most reviews. When a review needs the full
issue detail, including its comment thread and resolved workspace, invoke
`/rhdh-forge` by name with the issue reference. Do not add issue parsing to this
workflow.

When `linkedIssues` is empty, ask once whether there is a spec or issue to
judge against. If the author points at none, the PR body is the contract. Carry
that choice forward as `specSource` — the linked issue bodies, or the PR body —
into `/code-review` Spec. Spec still runs; the review does not wait on an issue.

## Jira keys

The script extracts Jira keys (for example, `RHIDP-1234`) from the PR body but
does not fetch them. When Jira detail affects the review, invoke `/rhdh-jira-api`
by name with the keys and use what it returns. Otherwise retain the keys and
continue. Do not select a Jira transport or inspect Jira credentials from this
workflow.

## CI status

`ciStatus` comes from `gh pr checks`. When it is `unknown`, invoke `/rhdh-forge`
to confirm against `gh run list --branch` before treating CI as missing or
failed. `/rhdh-forge` owns failed-log reads.

## After fetching

Proceed to `review-code.md`. Carry the complete context forward. Downstream
workflows read these fields by name, including `specSource`.
