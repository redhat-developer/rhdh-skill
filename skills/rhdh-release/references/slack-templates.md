# Slack Announcement Templates

Templates for release milestone announcements. Each template uses `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax for values that must be filled from Jira and Google Sheets data.

**Important:** Always wrap the final Slack message in a triple-backtick code block (` ```slack `) so the user can copy-paste directly into Slack.
