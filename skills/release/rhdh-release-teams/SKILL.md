# RHDH teams and leads

Answer who a team is, who leads it, and what identifier Jira knows it by.
Read-only.

## Route

Load `workflows/teams-and-leads.md`.

## Boundary with the neighbouring skills

- How many issues each team still has open against a release is
  `/rhdh-release-status`, whose per-team breakdown consumes the Cloud IDs this
  skill resolves.
- The freeze message that lists teams and pings their leads is
  `/rhdh-release-announce`.
- Assigning work to a person or team, or any Jira write, is `/rhdh-jira-api`.

## Completion

Complete when each team named in the answer carries its category, leads, Slack
handles, and Cloud ID as the source holds them, and the answer says whether the
Cloud IDs came from the Rich Filter export or from the spreadsheet column. Say
that inactive teams are excluded whenever the full roster was requested. A team
the user named that does not appear in the sheet is reported as absent, not
matched to the nearest similar name.
