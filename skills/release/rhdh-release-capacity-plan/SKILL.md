  Forecasts whether a named RHDH scrum team can take the rhdh-X.Y-candidate
  Features for a release from Jira RHIDP, RHDHPLAN, RHDHBUGS, and RHDHSUPP:
  sample-sprint velocity and interrupt (issues added after sprint start),
  Epic-first demand with a placeholder T-shirt→Fibonacci map when children
  have no story points, and two capacity ledgers through Code Freeze —
  historical planned-work velocity versus theoretical availability after
  meetings and interrupt. Use for "capacity for the 2.2 release", "can
  Plugins fit these 2.2 candidates", "release capacity plan", "how much
  interrupt into 2.1 planning", or "will COPE have room for 1.10 candidates".
  A whole-release horizon for one team — not filling the next sprint, and not
  whether the release is ready to ship.
compatibility: "acli on PATH with a Jira session; Python 3.9+ and uv; a Jira team ID and board ID; gog for the team mapping and release schedule. An authenticated host Atlassian adapter is optional for Greenhopper sprint-report reads."

# Plan RHDH release capacity

Say whether a team can take the candidate Features for a named release, with
both ledgers and the arithmetic that produced them. Read-only.

## Route

Load `workflows/plan-capacity.md`. Run it when a team is choosing which
`rhdh-X.Y-candidate` Features to take for a release.

## Boundary with the neighbouring skills

- Filling **the next sprint** — carryover, three-sprint velocity, ready queue —
  is `/rhdh-jira-sprint-plan`. This skill looks across remaining sprints to Code
  Freeze.
- What is still open against the release, the PI funnel, and Feature readiness
  are `/rhdh-release-status`. That skill reports status; this one reports fit.
- Milestone dates, including Code Freeze and Feature Freeze, are
  `/rhdh-release-schedule`.
- Team name to Cloud ID and board is `/rhdh-release-teams`.
- Board IDs, JQL, Team-field traps, roster GraphQL, and the Greenhopper
  sprint-report seam are `/rhdh-jira-api`.
- What a T-shirt size means when writing an issue is `/rhdh-jira-authoring`.
  This skill does not use that sprint-effort table for demand. Unsized T-shirts
  use a placeholder Fibonacci map in the script until a calibrated conversion
  exists. Never treat the Size field's 1–5 as story points.

## Completion

Complete when both ledgers name the sample sprints, the remaining-sprint count
through Code Freeze, the meeting factor, and the interrupt rate they used; when
every candidate Feature is either estimated (Epic children, or a T-shirt
placeholder) or listed as unsized; when any T-shirt fallback ran, the
placeholder map is printed with the demand; and when stretch Features are
called out as first cuts. Report the JQL behind the sample and whether any
search was truncated. Say when story-point coverage is under 50% and the unit
switched to issue counts. Print the arithmetic so a 40% meeting haircut on
already-observed Jira velocity cannot hide.
