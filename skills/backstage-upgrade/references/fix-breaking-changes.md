# Fix Breaking Changes

## Find relevant changelogs

Identify the Backstage versions between your current and target release. For each version, check the changelog:

- **Release notes:** `https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/docs/releases/v<VERSION>.md`
- **Detailed changelog:** `https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/docs/releases/v<VERSION>-changelog.md`

Focus on the **"Breaking Changes"** and **"Minor Changes"** sections. Patch changes rarely require code updates.

## Process

For each breaking change in the changelogs:

1. **Read the change description** — understand what was renamed, removed, or restructured
2. **Search the plugin's source** — `grep -r '<old API name>' src/` to check if the plugin is affected
3. **Apply the fix** — follow the changelog's migration guidance
4. **Verify** — `yarn tsc` after each fix to confirm the type error is resolved

## Common breaking change patterns

| Pattern | What to look for | Fix |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Renamed export | `import { OldName }` → `import { NewName }` | Update import |
| Moved package | `@backstage/plugin-x` → `@backstage-community/plugin-x` | Run `versions:migrate` |
| Removed API | `import { removedFn }` | Replace with recommended alternative from changelog |
| Changed signature | Type errors on function calls | Update call site per changelog |
| New required field | Missing property errors | Add the new field |

## Per-package changelogs

Each `@backstage/*` package has its own `CHANGELOG.md` in the Backstage repo. If `yarn tsc` flags errors in a specific package, check:

```
https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/packages/<package-name>/CHANGELOG.md
https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/<plugin-name>/CHANGELOG.md
```

## Composability with other skills

If you were directed here from another skill (e.g., `nfs-migration`), that skill may have its own breaking-change checklist. Apply both:

1. The upstream Backstage changelogs (this file)
2. Any skill-specific checklist the calling skill referenced (e.g., `nfs-migration/references/api-changes.md`)

The upstream changelogs cover all Backstage breaking changes. The skill-specific checklist covers domain-specific patterns (like NFS blueprint changes) that may not appear in the upstream changelog.

## Backstage Upgrade Helper

For visual diffs between Backstage versions, use the Upgrade Helper tool:

```

```

Select your current and target versions to see a diff of all template changes in `create-app`.
